# GoEnumerateAZ
A work in progress script for enumerating various Azure resources which could be interesting from a pentesting perspective... surely there are more modes worth implementing!


For now there are only two implemented modes, one which enuemrates deployment templates across an entire authorization scope, and another which enumeartes all custom role assignments which have been applied to both user managed and system managed identities.


If you implement more functionanal modes please open a PR...
